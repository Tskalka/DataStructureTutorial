# Stacks in Python

## What is a stack?
A stack is a data structure that insertion and deletion happen on the same end. These are commonly called push() and pop().

## Real world example of a stack
A good example of a stack is a long driveway that has a width of one car. Any car that comes into the driveway, adds itself to the end. Any car that leaves from the driveway, also leaves from the end.
