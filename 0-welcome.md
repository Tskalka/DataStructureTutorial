# Python Data Structure Tutorial

## I. Welcome
My name is Tyler Skalka, I am a computer science student currently studying at BYU Idaho. This is a python tutorial to help learn the basics of some data structures. This is not meant to be an all inclusive guide, but rather a good place to start.
We will be covering the topics of Stacks, Sets, and Trees all in python. There will be a solution provided for the test your knowledge problem. Good luck learning and have fun!

* What is a stack?
* Real World Example of a Stack
* How to implement a Stack using a list in Python
* Common Stack Operations/ Big O
* Example Problem
* Test your knowledge problem
 
## III. [Sets](https://github.com/Tskalka/DataStructureTutorial/blob/main/2-Sets.md)
* What is a set?
* How to implement a set in python
* Common set operations/ Big O
